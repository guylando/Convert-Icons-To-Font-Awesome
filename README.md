Inspiration: @afreeland wrote on stackoverflow an idea of how to convert icons to Font-Awesome icons:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13862963/jqgrid-pager-area-using-font-awesome-icons/25085687#25085687

Advantages of css method:
As @afreeland stated in the link above, this method of converting icons to Font-Awesome is very fast because it uses css instead of using javascript.

Why use Font-Awesome?
Font-Awesome has much more icons than jquery-ui and bootstrap. As stated here: http://fontawesome.bootstrapcheatsheets.com/ , Font-Awesome is a library that has one purpose: give nice icons. So since this is its only purpose, it is better at that than libraries like jquery-ui and bootstrap which have many other purposes.

Note: you must give priority for this ToAF.css file styles over your other icons styles so that can be achieved for example by copying the css content into a tag in your document.
