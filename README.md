Advantages of css method:
As @afreeland stated in the link above, this method of converting icons to Font-Awesome is very fast because it uses css instead of using javascript.

Why use Font-Awesome?
Font-Awesome has much more icons than jquery-ui and bootstrap. As stated here: http://fontawesome.bootstrapcheatsheets.com/ , Font-Awesome is a library that has one purpose: give nice icons. So since this is its only purpose, it is better at that than libraries like jquery-ui and bootstrap which have many other purposes.

Note: In order for the Font-Awesome icons to really override your icons, you must give priority to the css styles in the css files here over your other icons styles. That can be achieved for example by copying the css content into a style tag in your document.
